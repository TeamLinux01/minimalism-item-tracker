# minimalism-item-tracker
For a Minimalist, track items in the home (and when they leave). Play the 30 day Minimalism game.

## Original Outline

A program that allows a person to track the items that they have in their possession. It tracks the follow:

1. Name of item
1. Location of item
1. Amount of item
1. Price of item

It should be able to list, add and edit the items.
