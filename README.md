# minimalism-item-tracker
For a Minimalist, track items in the home (and when they leave). Play the 30 day Minimalism game.

## Original Outline

A program that allows a person to track the items that they have in their home. It tracks the follow:

1. Name of item
1. Location of item in the home
1. Amount (optional)
1. Date the item entered in the home (optional)
1. Purchase price (optional)
1. Universal Produce Code (optional)
1. If the item is still in the home

It should be able to list, add and edit the items in the home.
