# minimalism-item-tracker
For a Minimalist, track items in the home (and when they leave). Play the 30 day Minimalism game.

## Original Outline

A program that allows a person to track the items that have in their home. Tracks the follow:

1. Name
1. Location in home
1. Amount (optional)
1. Date entered in home (optional)
1. Purchase price (optional)
1. Universal Produce Code (optional)
1. If it is still in the home

It should be able to list, add and edit the "stuff" in the home.
